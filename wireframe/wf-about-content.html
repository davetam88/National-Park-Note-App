  <h1>
    APP's Inspiration

  </h1>

  <h2>
    The APP's inspiration came from my love of nature and the outdoors, and the unspoiled state of National Parks
    in
    the
    United States.
  </h2>


  The user of this APP can select/display any National Parks by State and further narrow down the park with your
  choice
  of Activity. Once selected, the user will be at the Park's View page, in which multiple Parks that meet that
  search
  criterion will be displayed, For each park, the APP will show a feature picture of the Park, the Park's
  official page
  Link, and address. The user can then visually explore their favorite park with the 'More Picture' and 'Videos'
  buttons.
