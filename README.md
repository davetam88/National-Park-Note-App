# National Park Note APP

All the information you need to know about your favorite National Parks in the United States in one easy to use APP. You can narrow down your <b>search by State and Activities</b>. Once your park(s) are located, you can see <b>more pictures</b> and/or <b>YouTube videos</b> for a particular park.

<p>This APP also allows the user to <b>create his/her own account</b>; Once logged in, beside the feature mentioned above, the user will be able to save a park's information to his/her account, rate it with a <b>rating number</b> and add <b>custom notes</b>. All the information will be stored in the APP and can be viewed later. The user can also sort the stored parks by using the following criteria: <b>Park Number, Park Name, Rating, State Name, and  Activity.</b>
